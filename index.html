    <h1>The Sublime Farewell of Gerhard Richter, Master of Doubt</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="frame">
<div class="p1">
  <p>An exquisite melancholy has settled upon the galleries of Marcel Breuer’s inverted ziggurat on Madison Avenue: an air of dashed aspirations, commitment and farewell. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which rented Breuer’s granite fortress from the relocated Whitney Museum of American Art in 2015, will be vacating the building in July, three years ahead of schedule. (Costs were too high.)

<p>The museum could not have offered a more apt final show — more rigorous, more resigned — than “Gerhard Richter: Painting After All.” It engrosses two floors of the Breuer with art of total mastery that also, at every turn, casts doubt on its own achievement. The squeegeed oils, the clammed-up portraits. The aseptic color charts, the matter-of-fact panes of glass and mirrors. Here they all are, poker-faced as ever, pushing forward with painting even as Mr. Richter subjects painting to endless criticism and interrogation. Some say the medium died in the 1960s, some say it’s never been more vital. He believes both, and, at times, neither.

<p>At this agitated moment for museums, desperate to prove their social impact, this greatest of living painters asks: What is contemporary art really for? Can it do anything? Have I accomplished anything? Mr. Richter, even as his auction prices have reached Alpine elevations, has never been certain — and this beautiful valediction, with 60 years of work, affirms the artistic and moral force of his irresolution and skepticism. (The artist, 88, has said this will very likely be the last major museum exhibition of his lifetime. It travels to Los Angeles in summer.)

<p>Know first that “Painting After All,” organized by Sheena Wagstaff, chairman of the Met’s department of modern and contemporary art, and the art historian Benjamin H.D. Buchloh, along with Met assistant curator Brinda Kumar, is not a retrospective of Mr. Richter’s career. At 18, I was one of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who found a strange and necessary comfort at the Museum of Modern Art’s sprawling survey of Mr. Richter’s painting, staged five months after the Sept. 11 attacks. That retrospective, in the winter of 2002, drew unexpectedly large audiences who found, in Mr. Richter’s difficulty, variety and uncertainty, a release from the pain downtown and the march to war in Washington. This new show joltingly opens with “September,” a small, blurred 2005 painting of a plane striking the World Trade Center — the first of many works here that look at violence, and its media representations, with a cool, ambivalent gaze.
